# Workspace Structure

Working directory: `/home/daytona`

## Standard Directories

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `results/` | Final deliverables (reports, visualizations) |
| `data/` | Intermediate storage (tool results, API responses) |
| `tools/` | MCP tool modules (auto-generated) |
| `code/` | Execution history (exec_0001.py, etc.) |

## Path Rules by Tool

**execute_code (Python)** - Use RELATIVE paths:
```python
with open('results/output.json', 'w') as f:  # Correct
with open('data/temp.json', 'w') as f:       # Correct
```

**File tools (Read/Write/Edit)** - Use RELATIVE paths:
```
file_path = "results/report.md"    # Correct
file_path = "config.yaml"          # Correct
```

**Bash tool** - Use ABSOLUTE paths (working_dir is `/home/daytona`):
```bash
ls /home/daytona/results/          # Correct
cat /home/daytona/data/output.json # Correct
ls results/                        # Also works (relative to working_dir)
```

**NEVER use these path patterns**:
- `/workspace/...` - Wrong prefix, becomes `/home/daytona/workspace/...`
- Absolute paths starting with `/results/` or `/data/` in Bash - these don't exist at root level
