# Image Auto-Upload

Images saved to `results/` are automatically uploaded to cloud storage. The URL is returned in the response.

**CRITICAL**: Use RELATIVE paths, NOT absolute paths:
- CORRECT: `plt.savefig('results/chart.png')` -> auto-uploaded, URL returned
- WRONG: `plt.savefig('/results/chart.png')` -> NOT uploaded!
{% if detailed | default(false) %}

## Creating Visualizations

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Option 1: plt.show() - chart captured and uploaded automatically
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(data)
plt.title("My Chart")
plt.show()  # Automatically uploaded, URL returned in response

# Option 2: Save to results/ - image uploaded automatically (use RELATIVE path!)
plt.savefig('results/chart.png')  # CORRECT: relative path
# plt.savefig('/results/chart.png')  # WRONG: absolute path won't be uploaded!
print("Saved chart")  # URL returned in response
```

Supported image formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, SVG, GIF, WEBP, BMP, TIFF

Response includes markdown image URLs: `![chart_title](https://storage-url/chart.png)`
{% else %}

Example:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(data)
plt.savefig('results/chart.png')  # Use relative path!
print("Chart saved")
```

The response includes: `![chart](https://storage-url/chart.png)` - reference this URL in your report.
