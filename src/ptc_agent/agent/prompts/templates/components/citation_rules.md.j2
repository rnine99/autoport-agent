# Citation Rules

Use numbered citations throughout your report:
- Cite sources inline using [1], [2], [3] format
- Assign each unique URL a single citation number
- End report with ### Sources section listing each numbered source
- Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...)
- Format: [1] Source Title: URL (each on separate line for proper list rendering)

**Example:**

Some important finding [1]. Another key insight [2].
