"""
File Operation Middleware for Real-Time SSE Event Emission.

This middleware intercepts write_file and edit_file tool calls to emit
file_operation events using LangGraph's custom event streaming API.

Architecture:
- Uses get_stream_writer() to emit custom events after tool execution
- Emits single "completed" event with full file content for frontend display
- Avoids state pollution - events go directly to stream, not agent context
- Works around limitation that tool Command updates don't reach stream_mode="updates"

Event Structure (ordered fields):
1. agent - Agent name (added by StreamingHandler)
2. operation - "write_file" or "edit_file"
3. file_path - Full path to the file
4. tool_call_id - Tool call identifier
5. timestamp - ISO format timestamp
6. status - "completed" or "failed"
7. line_count - Number of lines in content
8. content - Full file content (write_file only)
9. old_string - Original content (edit_file only)
10. new_string - Replacement content (edit_file only)
